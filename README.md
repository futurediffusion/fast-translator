# fast-translator

A small PySide6 application that floats above other windows and translates
Spanish text into English using the Google Translate API.

## Usage

Run the translator with:

```bash
python floating_translator.py
```

The application contains a built-in example API key, but you can modify the
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` constant in `floating_translator.py` to use your own.
